\section{Introduction}
Fuzzy logic is an ever expanding field, and 

In this dissertation, I will be focusing on creating and online fuzzy logic inferencing and visualisation system. 

Producing an online fuzzy set manipulation system may, at first, seem relatively trivial, but this project will focus specifically on usability and accessibility of the system, so that it is as easy to use as possible, by novices and experts alike. 


There are already many different software systems available for working with fuzzy sets, but whilst researching these systems as part of my second year group project, I found that the majority of available systems suffer from one of two key flaws: difficulty of use, or difficulty of access - and thus the motivation for this project was born. 

Whilst working on my second year group project, I had to spend a considerable amount of time researching 


{\color{red}setting out the aims and objectives of your project
\begin{enumerate}
\item a statement of the importance of the subject\\
fuzzy logic is becoming ever more important. important not to reserve it just for experts
\item mention of previous work on the subject\\
matlab, fuzzy toolkituon, juzzy, xfuzzy ...
\item a justification for dealing with the subject\\
researching fuzzy logic systems last year, i discovered that they are either hard to use or hard to access/install/download
\item a statement of your objectives\\
to produce an online fuzzy logic system that allows for the inferencing and visualisation of fuzzy sets, whilst being as easy to use and access as possible.
\item a statement of the limitations of the work\\
type 1 fuzzy logic
\item a mention of some of the differing viewpoints on the subject\\
could be argued that it doesn't need to be accessible, because only experts will use it. but i am attempting to open fuzzy logic up, as it's influence in the western world is much lesser than it is in the eastern.
\item a definition of the topic being discussed\\
