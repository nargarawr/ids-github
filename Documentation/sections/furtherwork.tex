\section{Further Work}
%{\color{red} A list of things that could be done to expand the system in the future / things I did not have time to complete }

\subsection{Type-2 Fuzzy Logic}
\label{sec:type2}

%{\color{red} To include a briewf explanation of what type 2 fuzzy logic is, and why it is different to type 1. Also to include why it was not included.}

\subsection{Backend Interoperability}
%{\color{red} Talk about how the majority of the system is written in JavaScript, so that the system could be ported to different inference engine backends with little work.}

\subsection{Customisations}

%{\color{red} 
%Talk about potential for a site that is more customisable for the user, as this would help them feel more at home, and make the system more effective for them. But also mention how basic customisations (like changing the background colour), wouldn't really make that much of a difference}
