\section{System Designs}
{\color{red} 
Display and discuss all of the designs of the system, including the multiple iterations this went through. Mention how the designs address the problem, why they are designed the way they are, including software science, 13 sins of design, usability heuristics, and golden rules for design.

George Miller- the magical number seven \cite{miller1956magical}.
I didn't want to bombard the user with too much information, hence the condensed view. (To help reduce to cognitive load on the user, the majority of screens have remnants of information from the previous screen on them (this is to combat the 7 $\pm$ 2 chunks of information in working memory))}


\subsection{The Design Process}
{\color{red}  }



\subsection{UI Design}
{\color{red}  }


	\subsubsection{First Iteration}
	{\color{red} ``straight up javascript and html'', loses the power of R }



	\subsubsection{Second Iteration}
	{\color{red} tabbed based system with long horizontal variables. maintaining large systems becomes more difficult. something about hci software science }


	\subsubsection{Third Iteration}		
	{\color{red} Fully referenced explanation of why the current design is optimal }


\subsection{Navigation/Control Flow Design}		
{\color{red} Section to detail the navigation and flow of the system, and all design choices as a result of that }

\subsection{Internal Design}
{\color{red} Show how the backend and foreground interact, and how this was designed (see picture from presentation) }
