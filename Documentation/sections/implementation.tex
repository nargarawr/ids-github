\section{Software Implementation}

%{\color{red}

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item simple introduction to the program, what it does and who it is for
%\item technical solution adopted, what technical solution has been implemented, whether it is ideal, whether an alternative exists
%\item software engineering information, program design, structure, definition language, test plans
%\item development approach used (evolutionary, build and fix)
%\item Problems encountered (bugs, errors, uncompleted sections of code)
%\item hardware/ software requirements
%\item Friendly errors
%\item Help system is dedicated, but offers links to other, helpful, external resources
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Key Implementation Decisions}
\label{sec:kid}
%{\color{red} A list of the tools and platforms that were used in the project, including justification for their inclusion. (To cover: Languages used, Web technologies used, Shiny, Bootstrap, JQuery) - using an old version of bootstrap because i was more familiar with it and work had already begun}


\subsection{Detailed Description of the Implemented System}
%{\color{red} A detailed description of the system, including how the individual sections were implemented, how they interact, strengths and weaknesses of individual components. Talk about the system as a whole as well, covering how the parts interacted and how well they did so. buggy as fuck r :(}


\subsection{Problems Encountered}
%{\color{red} 
%A description of any major problems encountered during the implementation of the project, causes of these, and their resolutions - if there were any. Talk about the impact of the problems on the project as a whole, and how this potentially affected it (like changes to designs, etc) - SHINY BEING A MASSIVE CUNT, but fixing it! confusion due to such a large code base
