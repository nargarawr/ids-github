\section{User Evaluation Test Instructions}
\label{app-userEval}
The purpose of this test is to construct the fuzzy logic tipper example, in three different software systems, so that the strengths and weaknesses of each of these systems can be identified. The tipper example is a simple fuzzy system that uses food quality (rated from 0 to 10) and service quality (rated from 0 to 10) as inputs, to determine how much of a tip should be left (between 0 and 30 percent). \ \\
